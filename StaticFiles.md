# Serving Static Files

We can use the Express to serve static files as well.

First we need to create some files for the server.
[include, template="full"](examples/static/index.html)

## Respond with static file
[include, template="full"](examples/static_file.js)

## Respond with files in a directory
[include, template="full"](examples/static_dir.js)
